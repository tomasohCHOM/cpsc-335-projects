Submission is for Project 4 of CPSC 335 (Section 04)

Make sure that all the files are included to run the 
program accordingly. Namely, those files are: main.py, 
rentals.py and delay.py.

IMPORTANT: Due to multiple Canvas submissions, please 
make sure that the names of the files have no "-x" at 
the end of them. For instance, if there is a file like 
"main-1.py", please change it to just "main.py" (same for 
schedules.py, subsets.py, and sample2.txt). Otherwise, the 
program will NOT run correctly.

To run this program, make sure that you have Python3 
installed on your machine.

Then, run the following command on the terminal to 
execute the program on Linux/Mac:

python3 main.py

If using Windows, run this command on the terminal:

python main.py

Or:

py main.py

You can follow the instructions from the command line
to run the program for either Problem 1 or Problem 2.


You can follow the instructions from the command line
to run the program for either Problem 1 or Problem 2.
To run more test cases against either algorithm, locate
the files rentals.py and delay.py, where you can modify the
list variable sample_input (used to run all the test cases
of the algorithm). Follow the instructions per the comments
so that you may add more test cases for the algorithms.


Thank you.
