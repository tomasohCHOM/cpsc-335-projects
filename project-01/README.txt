Submission is for Project 1 of CPSC 335-04

Make sure that all the files are included to run the 
program accordingly. Namely, those files are: main.py, 
pairs.py, and greedy.py

To run this program, make sure that you have Python3 
installed on your machine.

Then, run the following command on the terminal to 
execute the program on Linux/Mac:

python3 main.py

If using Windows, run this command on the terminal:

python main.py

Or:

py main.py

You can follow the instructions from the command line
to run the program for either Problem 1 or Problem 2.
To run more test cases against either algorithm, locate
the files greedy.py and pairs.py, where you can modify the
list variable sample_input (used to run all the test cases
of the algorithm). Follow the instructions per the comments
so that you may add more test cases for the algorithms.

Thank you.
